# Ola! 初めまして！你好 👋 🐰

## Call me ___Aurel___, 叫***淑櫻***也可以🌸

## __!! Introduction Coming Up !!__
Born on August 20,1999 as a proud Indonesian in a beautiful city called Surabaya. The oldest among 3 siblings, I have the privilege to order my little brother and sister around haha 😂, just kidding...or am I? Both my parents work so I've learnt to handle the household from early age. My family isn't the best for sure, but to me, they are my foundation.

Anyways, to the important bits:

- Currently a GMBA student in Tunghai University, Taiwan 
- Majored in Hospitality Management for Bachelor's degree
    - I like to observe human behaviour, hence my interest in psychology and service industry
- I'm pretty good at learning language and culture, some martial arts, some skills in public speaking here and there...
    - "Jack of all trades, master of none"
- I really want to travel to Japan
